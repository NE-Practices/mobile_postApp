# Over-engineered Social Media App

This is a social media app that was meant to just use json-placeholder as a backend, but I decided to over-engineer it and build my own backend with Nodejs, Express, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The frontend is built with React Native. But it was a mistake, I ended up building 2 apps instead of 1.

## Tech Stacks

- React Native
